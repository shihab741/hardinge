Hardinge theme for WordPress Read Me:

While experimenting with WordPress, I developed this theme. It’s not completed yet. But some primary tasks are completed and ready to use.

This theme has a different front page template and I think some people may find this theme useful for their personal site or blog. 

You can use this theme for free. I hope to upload an improved version soon. Meanwhile comments and suggestions on this theme are welcome.

Regards,
