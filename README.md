Hardinge theme for WordPress
===========================
While experimenting with WordPress, I developed this theme. It’s not completed yet. But some primary tasks are completed and ready to use.

This responsive theme has two different menu areas, three widget areas on all pages and an extra widget area on single page. A different front page with banner image and different widget area is added. Other facilities include: social links, breadcrumb.  I think some people may find this theme useful for their personal site or blog. For customization and adding more functionality, please contact me.

You can use this theme for free. I hope to upload an improved version soon. Meanwhile comments and suggestions on this theme are welcome.
